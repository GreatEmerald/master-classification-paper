    %\item 4 machine learning model groups tested for deriving 7 land cover fractions globally
    \item 7 land cover fractions derived globally using machine learning algorithms
    \item Multi-step approach proposed for dealing with zero inflation in fraction data

    \item The approach provides a middle ground between discrete and fractional mapping
    \item The approach gives the best guess and improves estimation of 0\% and 100\% fractions
    \item Comprehensive spatial accuracy assessment based on over 20\,000 points
    \item Multi-fraction land cover mapping shown as an alternative to discrete classification
