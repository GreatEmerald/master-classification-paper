	abstract = {Increasing interest in wetlands for environmental management requires an understanding of the location, spatial extent, and configuration of the resource. The National Wetlands Inventory is the most commonly used data source for this information. However, its accuracy is limited in some contexts, such as agricultural and forested wetlands. An large number of studies have mapped wetlands worldwide from the perspective of land use and land cover change. However, information on the actual wetland planting areas annually is limited, which greatly impacts ongoing research. In this case study of the West Songnen Plain, we developed a simple algorithm for the quick mapping of wetlands by utilizing their unique physical features, such as annual display of phenological land-cover change of exposed soils, shallow flooding water, and plants from multi-temporal Landsat images. Temporal variations of the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) and Land Surface Water Index (LSWI) derived from Landsat images in 2010 for wetlands at different growth stages were analyzed. Results show that during the ante-tillering phase, the NDVI value (above zero) is lower than the LSWI value of paddies because of flooding of shallow water; during the reproductive and ripening phases, the NDVI value is higher than the LSWI value (above zero); and during the post-harvest wetland planting phase, the NDVI value is still higher than the LSWI value, but the LSWI value is negative. Wetland areas can be detected using one or two images in the optimum time window. The algorithm based on the difference of NDVI and LSWI values derived from Landsat images was used to extract the actual wetland planting area. Validated alongside statistical data, the algorithm showed high accuracy. Therefore, this algorithm highlights the unique features of wetlands and can help in mapping the actual wetland area annually on a regional scale. Results further indicate that the new method has a classification accuracy of 92 {\%}. In comparison, two traditional methods based on Landsat-7/ETM registered accuracy rates of only 83 {\%} and 87 {\%} respectively.},

	abstract = {Random forests are a commonly used tool for classification and for ranking candidate predictors based on the so-called variable importance measures. These measures attribute scores to the variables reflecting their importance. A drawback of variable importance measures is that there is no natural cutoff that can be used to discriminate between important and non-important variables. Several approaches, for example approaches based on hypothesis testing, were developed for addressing this problem. The existing testing approaches require the repeated computation of random forests. While for low-dimensional settings those approaches might be computationally tractable, for high-dimensional settings typically including thousands of candidate predictors, computing time is enormous. In this article a computationally fast heuristic variable importance test is proposed that is appropriate for high-dimensional data where many variables do not carry any information. The testing approach is based on a modified version of the permutation variable importance, which is inspired by cross-validation procedures. The new approach is tested and compared to the approach of Altmann and colleagues using simulation studies, which are based on real data from high-dimensional binary classification settings. The new approach controls the type I error and has at least comparable power at a substantially smaller computation time in the studies. Thus, it might be used as a computationally fast alternative to existing procedures for high-dimensional data settings where many variables do not carry any information. The new approach is implemented in the R package vita.},

	abstract = {Forests worldwide are in a state of flux, with accelerating losses in some regions and gains in others. Hansen et al. (p. 850) examined global Landsat data at a 30-meter spatial resolution to characterize forest extent, loss, and gain from 2000 to 2012. Globally, 2.3 million square kilometers of forest were lost during the 12-year study period and 0.8 million square kilometers of new forest were gained. The tropics exhibited both the greatest losses and the greatest gains (through regrowth and plantation), with losses outstripping gains. Quantification of global forest change has been lacking despite the recognized importance of forest ecosystem services. In this study, Earth observation satellite data were used to map global forest loss (2.3 million square kilometers) and gain (0.8 million square kilometers) from 2000 to 2012 at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil{\textquoteright}s well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms. These results depict a globally consistent and locally relevant record of forest change.},

Alerts were mapped on a weekly basis as new terrain-corrected Landsat 7 and 8 images were made available; results are presented for all of 2014 and through September 2015. The three study areas represent different stages of the forest land use transition, with all featuring a variety of disturbance dynamics including logging, smallholder agriculture, and agroindustrial development. Results for Peru were formally validated and alerts found to have very high user{\rq}s accuracies and moderately high producer{\rq}s accuracies, indicating an appropriately conservative product suitable for supporting land management and enforcement activities. Complete pan-tropical coverage will be implemented during 2016 in support of the Global Forest Watch initiative. To date, Global Forest Watch produces annual global forest loss area estimates using a comparatively richer set of Landsat inputs. The alert product is presented as an interim update of forest disturbance events between comprehensive annual updates.

	abstract = {Satellite based land cover classification for Africa{\rq}s semi-arid ecosystems is hampered commonly by heterogeneous landscapes with mixed vegetation and small scale land use. Higher spatial resolution remote sensing time series data can improve classification results under these difficult conditions. While most large scale land cover mapping attempts rely on moderate resolution data, PROBA-V provides five-daily time series at 100 m spatial resolution. This improves spatial detail and resilience against high cloud cover, but increases the data load. Cloud-based processing platforms can leverage large scale land cover monitoring based on such finer time series. We demonstrate this with PROBA-V 100 m time series data from 2014--2015, using temporal metrics and cloud filtering in combination with in-situ training data and machine learning, implemented on the ESA (European Space Agency) Cloud Toolbox infrastructure. We apply our approach to two use cases for a large study area over West Africa: land- and forest cover classification. Our land cover classification reaches a 7\% to 21\% higher overall accuracy when compared to four global land cover maps (i.e., Globcover-2009, Cover-CCI-2010, MODIS-2010, and Globeland30). Our forest cover classification shows 89\% correspondence with the Tropical Ecosystem Environment Observation System (TREES)-3 forest cover data which is based on spatially finer Landsat data. This paper illustrates a proof of concept for cloud-based ``big-data'' driven land cover monitoring. Furthermore, we show that a wide range of temporal metrics can be extracted from detailed PROBA-V 100 m time series data to continuously optimize land cover monitoring.},

After discussing the problem On a basis combining intuition with some hard, cold facts about the distributions of certain test quantities (or "statistics") a simple and definite procedure is proposed for dividing treatments into distinguishable groups, and for determining that the treatments within some of these groups are different, although there is not enough evidence to say "which is which."

	abstract = {Land cover change detection is an important research and application area for analysts of remote sensing data. The primary objective of the research described here was to develop a change detection method capable of accommodating spatial and classification uncertainty in generating an accurate map of land cover change using high resolution satellite imagery. As a secondary objective, this method was designed to facilitate the mapping of particular types and locations of change based on specific study goals. Urban land cover change pertinent to surface water quality in Raleigh, North Carolina, was assessed using land cover classifications derived from pan-sharpened, 0.61 m QuickBird images from 2002 and 2005. Post-classification map errors were evaluated using a fuzzy logic approach. First, a ‘change index’ representing a quantitative gradient along which land cover change is characterized by both certainty and relevance, was created. The result was a continuous representation of change, a product type that retains more information and flexibility than discrete maps of change. Finally, fuzzy logic and change reasoning results were integrated into a binary change/no change map that quantified the most certain, likely, and relevant change regions within the study area. A ‘from-to’ change map was developed from this binary map inserting the type of change identified in the raw post-classification map. A from-to change map had an overall accuracy of 78.9\% (κ = 0.747) and effectively mapped land cover changes posing a threat to water quality, including increases in impervious surface. This work presents an efficient fuzzy framework for transforming map uncertainty into accurate and practical change analysis.},

	abstract = {Regularly updated land cover information at continental or national scales is a requirement for various land management applications as well as biogeochemical and climate modeling exercises. However, monitoring or updating of map products with sufficient spatial detail is currently not widely practiced due to inadequate time-series coverage for most regions of the Earth. Classifications of coarser spatial resolution data can be automatically generated on an annual or finer time scale. However, discrete land cover classifications of such data cannot sufficiently quantify land surface heterogeneity or change. This study presents a methodology for continuous and discrete land cover mapping using moderate spatial resolution time series data sets. The method automatically selects sample data from higher spatial resolution maps and generates multiple decision trees. The leaves of decision trees are interpreted considering the sample distribution of all classes yielding class membership maps, which can be used as estimates for the diversity of classes in a coarse resolution cell. Results are demonstrated for the heterogeneous, small-patch landscape of Germany and the bio-climatically varying landscape of South Africa. Results have overall classification accuracies of 80\%. A sensitivity analysis of individual modules of the classification process indicates the importance of appropriately chosen features, sample data balanced among classes, and an appropriate method to combine individual classifications. The comparison of classification results over several years not only indicates the method's consistency, but also its potential to detect land cover changes.},

The present study deals with the changes in land-cover in three worst affected districts (Anand, Vadodara and Kheda) of Gujarat state in India due to severe flood during 2005. The Indian Remote Sensing (IRS) P6 Linear Imaging Self Scanning (LISS) III satellite imageries of pre- and post-flooding periods were used as sources of information for the study area. Three classification approaches (unsupervised ISODATA, supervised Maximum Likelihood Classifier, and fuzzy rule based) were used to extract flood induced land-cover information. Results obtained from the above classification approaches were compared. Soft computing technique such as fuzzy based image classification gave better separability amongst classes as compared to hard classification techniques. The accuracy assessment showed that the fuzzy approach can predict land-cover more accurately than traditional approach and also showed great potential for dealing with mapping of flood induced land-cover. Unsupervised classification results for the period October 2004 to October 2005 revealed decrease in inland water bodies (14.49\%) and agricultural area (6.42\%) while increase in remaining land-cover. During February 2005 to February 2006, all land-cover classes decreased except agricultural fallow and sparse vegetation. In case of supervised classification, decreasing trend was observed only in case of agricultural area (6.78\%) during October 2004 to October 2005. Similarly, during February 2005 to February 2006, increase in coastal water bodies (0.73\%) and sparse vegetation (1.7\%) was observed where as decreasing trend was noticed in the remaining land-cover classes. In fuzzy based classification, only decrease in agricultural area (7.09\%) was observed from October 2004 to October 2005, whereas during February 2005 to February 2006, decrease in area was exhibited in all land-cover classes except coastal water bodies and sparse vegetation. Change detection indicated interchange of areas between inland and coastal water bodies and decrease in agricultural area leading to increase in area of agricultural fallow and sparse vegetation.},

The proposed scheme is developed in the framework of wavelet-fuzzy hybridization, a soft computing approach. The wavelet features obtained from wavelet transform on an image provides spatial and spectral characteristics (i.e., texture information) of pixels and hence can be utilized effectively for improving accuracy in classification, instead of using original spectral features. Four different fuzzy classifiers are considered for this purpose and evaluated using different wavelet features. Wavelet feature based fuzzy classifiers produced consistently better results compared to original spectral feature based methods on various images used in the present investigation. Further, the performance of the Biorthogonal3.3 (Bior3.3) wavelet is observed to be superior to other wavelets. This wavelet in combination with fuzzy product aggregation reasoning-rule outperformed all other methods. Potentiality of the proposed soft computing approach in isolating various land covers are evaluated both visually and quantitatively using indexes like β measure of homogeneity and Xie-Beni measure of compactness and separability.},

Tested wavelet transform to get spatiotemporal multispectral features, then fed it to models: fuzzy k-NN, fuzzy ML, fuzzy explicit and fuzzy product aggregation reasoning rule (FPARR).
Suggests first analysing coarse pixels, then finer ones, in order to take context into account. That's how wavelet transform works: you decompose components into sort of edge-detects of horizontal, vertical and diagonal, and you build up pyramid layers. Then that data can be fed into a classifier, and it contains information about the spatial context too.
Fuzzy k-NN is basically fuzzy c-means, except that it takes k neighbours' centroids rather than the centroid of the whole set. It will be the same if k=N. (Actually, supervised fuzzy c-means is in fact a fuzzy nearest centroid classifier.)
Wavelet transform helps with separation of classes, and the resulting hard imagery is also very slightly better. They didn't look into a confusion matrix, though, and the classes were a bit arbitrary (probably from clustering).
Fuzzy k-NN and fuzzy ML were the worst, fuzzy explicit (similar to FuzzyNPC) was better, and FRBS was the best, with or without wavelet data.},

The fuzzy segmentation stage outputs fuzzy-crisp and crisp-fuzzy image regions whose spectral and geometric properties are measured to populate the set of predictors used to estimate land cover at single dates. The variant of fuzzy image segmentation is implemented using advanced machine learning techniques and tested in a rapidly urbanizing area using Landsat multi-spectral imagery. Experimental results suggest that the method produces accurate characterization of continuous land cover classes.

	abstract = {Evaluations of existing land cover maps have revealed that high landscape heterogeneity and small patch sizes are a major reason for misclassification. These problems globally occur in biomes of mixed vegetation structure and are particularly relevant for African savannas. This paper presents a multi-resolution approach to derive fractional cover of vegetation growth forms at sub-pixel level, aiming at an improved mapping of land cover in the African grassland, savanna and shrubland biome. Fractional cover is delineated for woody growth forms (trees and shrubs), herbaceous growth forms, and bare surface. The approach incorporates very high resolution (QuickBird/IKONOS, 0.6–1m), high resolution (Landsat TM/ETM+, 30m), and medium resolution data (MODIS, 250m). While QuickBird/IKONOS data are classified into discrete classes, at Landsat and MODIS resolutions, sub-pixel cover is delineated using non-parametric ensemble regression trees from the random forest family. The propagation of errors in the hierarchical multi-resolution approach is assessed with Monte Carlos simulations. The multi-resolution approach allows the adequate description of the heterogeneous vegetation structure in selected study regions of Southern Africa. The RMSE of the delineated fractional cover values range between 3.1\% and 8.2\% when compared with higher resolution data and between 4.4\% and 9.9\% when compared with field surveys. Errors at the Landsat resolution show minor influence on the accuracy of the MODIS results. Regarding the inter-resolution error propagation, for 90\% of the Monte Carlo simulations, errors at the Landsat resolution resulted in RMSEs for MODIS increased by less than 4\% (woody vegetation), 3.5\% (herbaceous vegetation) and 2\% (bare surface).},

The high resolution data are classified to categorical land cover maps using an analyst mediated classification workflow. Our initial application of these data is to evaluate a global 30m Landsat-derived, continuous field tree cover product. For this application, the categorical reference classification produced at 2m resolution is converted to percent tree cover per 30mpixel (secondary sampling unit)for comparison to Landsat-derived estimates of tree cover. We provide example results (based on a subsample of 25 sample blocks in South America) illustrating basic analyses of agreement that can be produced from these reference data. Commercial high resolution data availability and data quality are shown to provide a viable means of validating continuous field tree cover.

	abstract = {Forthcoming spaceborne imaging spectrometers will provide novel opportunities for mapping urban composition globally. To move from case studies for single cities towards comparative and more operational analyses, generalized models that may be transferred throughout space are desired. In this study, we investigated how single regression models can be spatially generalized for vegetation-impervious-soil (VIS) mapping across multiple cities. The combination of support vector regression (SVR) with synthetically mixed training data generated from spectral libraries was used for fraction mapping. We developed three local models based on separate spectral libraries from Berlin (Germany), Brussels (Belgium), and Santa Barbara (U.S.), and a generalized model based on a combined multi-site spectral library. To examine the performance and transferability of the generalized model compared to local models, we first applied all model variants to simulated Environmental Mapping and Analysis Program (EnMAP) data from the three cities that were represented in the models, i.e., known sites. Next, we transferred the models to two unknown sites not represented in the models, San Francisco Bay Area (U.S.) and Munich (Germany). In the first mapping constellation, results demonstrated that the generalized model was capable of accurately mapping VIS fractions across all three known sites. Average mean absolute errors (AV-MAEs) were 8.5, 12.2, and 11.0\% for Berlin, Brussels, and Santa Barbara. The performance of the generalized model was very similar to the local models, with ∆AV-MAEs falling within a range of ±0.7\%. A detailed assessment of fraction maps and class-wise accuracies confirmed that modeling errors related to remaining limitations of urban mapping based on optical remote sensing data rather than to the choice between a local or generalized model. For the second mapping constellation, the generalized model proved to be useful for mapping vegetation and impervious fractions in the unknown sites. MAEs for both cover types were 5.4 and 10.9\% for the San Francisco Bay Area, and 6.3 and 15.4\% for Munich. In contrast, the three local models were only found to have similar accuracies as the generalized model for one of the two sites or for individual VIS categories. Despite the enhanced transferability of the generalized model to the unknown sites, deficiencies remained for accurate soil mapping. MAEs were 22.4 and 12.3\%, and high over - and underestimations were observed at the low and high end of the fraction range. These shortcomings indicated possible limitations of the spectral libraries to account for the spectral characteristics of soils in the unknown sites. Overall, we conclude that the combination of SVR and synthetically mixed training data generated from multi-site libraries constitutes a flexible modeling approach for generalized urban mapping across multiple cities.},

	abstract = {Tree canopy cover is a major biophysical attribute of dryland ecosystems. Monitoring its long-term changes over large spatial extents is critical for understanding woody vegetation response to climate variability and global change. However, quantifying tree canopy cover with remotely sensed data remains a challenge for dryland ecosystems where vegetation is sparse and trees, shrubs, and grasses often co-exist at fine spatial scales. In this study, we developed a full SMA (spectral mixture analysis) method that regressed photosynthetic vegetation (PV), non-photosynthetic vegetation (NPV), and shade components of the SMA with dryland tree cover to monitor tree cover dynamics on a pinyon–juniper woodland landscape in Nevada, USA using Landsat TM data. We assessed 1) how well this method could estimate tree cover in both disturbed (chained and burned) and non-disturbed woodland patches and 2) how sensitive this method was to the confounding effects of climatic variations. The assessment was conducted in comparison with two other more commonly used methods that regressed NDVI or PV with tree cover. Our results showed that although PV performed better than NDVI, both methods overestimated tree canopy cover within recently disturbed woodland patches where the confounding effects of shrubs on greenness index were higher than in non-disturbed patches. The full SMA efficiently quantified variations within post-chaining patches in addition to non-disturbed patches, but overestimated tree cover within burned patches. Of the three methods tested, only full SMA showed promising capability for mitigating the confounding effects of interannual climatic variations on monitoring the woodland recovery process. Our results are generalizable to other semi-arid landscapes comprising a mosaic of small-statured trees intermixed with shrub steppe vegetation.},
